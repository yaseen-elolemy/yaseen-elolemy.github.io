# OS developement
## Intro

-> For a long time, I have been intersted in the innerworkings of operating systems, especially in the field of Cybersecurity, this is why, I decided to take an actual step into the world of learning OS developement,
hopefuly it is something strong I can add to my cv, and I will get great experience from it. I will get my intro from [OSDEV](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page), then maybe I will branch or check into other sources, 
but people say this is very good and competent for beginners
